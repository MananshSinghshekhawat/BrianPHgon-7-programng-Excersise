/*
Many programs display information to the end user in one
form but use a different form inside the program. For
example, you may show the word Blue on the screen, but
behind the scenes youâ€™ll have a numerical value for that
color or an internal value because you may need to represent
the textual description in another language for Spanishspeaking visitors.
Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to the
corresponding month. Prompt for a number and display the
corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and
12 being December. For any value outside thatrange, display
an appropriate error message.
Example Output
Please enter the number of the month: 3
The name of the month is March.
