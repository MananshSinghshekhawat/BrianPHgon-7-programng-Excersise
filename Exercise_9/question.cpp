/*

Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather
than follow standard rounding rules.
Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a
room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one
gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons
needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.
Example Output
You will need to purchase 2 gallons of
paint to cover 360 square feet.
Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must
round up to the next whole gallon.
